    <div id="poema">
    <p>She followed, eyes without dou8bt, <br>
       Through path9s where emptiness embraces. <br>
       Her friend, a shadow that 2jazes concealed, <br>
       6Led her into the silence of disgra3ce.
    </p>
    <p>Light steps, yet with cur4ving chills, <br>
       The air vibrated with tones of warning. <br>
       Each choice created 5quiet agonies, <br>
       11And the light faded under the judgement.
    </p>
    <p>The echo ja1zes where the wind goes 7quiet and silent, <br>
       Truth hides what it dares not show. <br>
       And the friend, with a voice that cradles, <br>
       Left her onl10y the void and her soul.
